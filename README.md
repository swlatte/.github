# Welcome to swlatte

swlatte, which stands for "she was latte," embodies the feeling of comfort and warmth, much like a cup of latte shared with someone special. Alternatively, it can represent "Sena Wardana/Latte," combining my name, Sena, and my favorite idol, Freya Jayawardana âœ¨.

We appreciate your interest in our projects ðŸ™Œ.
